    "# Stress and Achievement Prediction Plus Prescription\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is twofold: with a given user’s inputs predict what their level of achievement and daily stress is, and then make recommendations on what they can change to improve their level of stress and achievement. Model building and training were handled with Keras/TensorFlow in a prior notebook so that this notebook could simply load the model and perform inference for a given user in minimal time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this notebook is run it will use user inputs to create a dataframe, the first row of the dataframe (index 'Actual') will be the user’s inputs, then it generates additional dataframe rows keeping all the user inputs the same except incrementing/decrementing one element by one (the index label states the change). This way a user can observe how a small lifestyle change could impact their life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This model does not use the features 'BMI_RANGE', 'SUFFICIENT_INCOME', and 'GENDER', these turned out to be poor predictors (surprisingly). 'WORK_LIFE_BALANCE_SCORE' was also dropped, this score provided by the survey based on user input (including the target values) so even if a user had known the right value to put there would be data leakage. for a more detailed EDA, you can view a previous notebook of mine: https://www.kaggle.com/schorsi/stress-and-achievement-ml-totw\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimers: Correlation and causation are not the same, the recommendations this notebook generates may not have the expected impact. While this model is able to accurately approximate the level of daily stress, it is less precise with achievement. Achievement most likely has some confounding variables involved, so take these recommendations with a grain of salt. My recommendation would be to look at the predictions for achievement under 'Actual' and if they accurately reflect your current state then I would imagine the predictions given slight changes would also stay similarly accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub link for the project, including training notebook and model: https://github.com/Neil-Kloper/Stress-and-Achievement-Prediction-Plus-Prescription\n",
    "\n",
    "> Version: 1.0  code complete, some additional links and documentation will be added later. The next steps include adding a GitHub page with the model and all relevant notebooks then creating a similar notebook on Google Colab so that it's accessible to a wider audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Version: 1.1: Updated the code to match the updates to the dataset. Updated model now that more data is availible (Thanks to Yvon Dalat!). Added GitHub link."
