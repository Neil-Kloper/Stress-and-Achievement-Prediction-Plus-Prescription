# Stress-and-Achievement-Prediction-Plus-Prescription
This repo houses the code and model used for predicting stress and achievement and making recommendations on how to improve these metrics. The data used to train the model is survey data related to health and wellbeing.

Thanks to Yvon Dalat for making the dataset public and updating it so I could improve this project!

Disclaimers: Correlation and causation are not the same, the recommendations this project generates may not have the expected impact. While this model is able to accurately approximate the level of daily stress, it is less precise with achievement. Achievement most likely has some confounding variables involved, so take these recommendations with a grain of salt. My recommendation would be to look at the predictions for achievement under 'Actual' and if they accurately reflect your current state then I would imagine the predictions given slight changes would also stay similarly accurate.

    Version: 1.0 code complete, some additional links and documentation will be added later. The next steps include adding a Google Colab notebook link so that it's accessible to a wider audience. Later I will pursue other deployment options.

    Version: 1.1 Google Colab version complete and added code tweeks

    Version: 1.2 Deployment on Heroku code complete, extensive formatting tweeks required. In the interum app is not set to live until it is ready to go live.
